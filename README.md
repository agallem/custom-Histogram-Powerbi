# Power BI Histogram Visual

This project is a work in progress. I am currently working on adding more features.

This is a custom Power BI visual for creating interactive histogram charts. Built using **D3.js**, **TypeScript**, and the **Power BI Custom Visual SDK**.

## Features
✔️ Supports dynamic binning  
✔️ Customizable colors  
✔️ Uses `plotly.js` for enhanced rendering
